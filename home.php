	<p>The phones share high-end hardware and have new features that signal the direction of where current phones are heading -- namely 5G connectivity (which all three phones have) and screens with a higher, 120Hz refresh rate. </p>
	<h3>Release date</h3>
	<p>Samsung\'s latest flagship phones, known as the Galaxy S20, S20 Plus and S20 Ultraare available online and in retail stores. Since the company first announced the devices in February at Samsung Unpacked (where it also announced the novel Galaxy Z Flip foldable phone), CNET has tested the S20 Ultra\'s incredibly impressive camera zoom and conducted drop tests (TL;DR: the camera survives). </p>
	<h3>Price</h3>
	<p>You can get the unlocked Samsung Galaxy S20 5G for $680. That\'s after cash back on your Amazon Prime credit card, but still one of the best deals to date. Plus: A Qi charging pad to go with it for $6. For a limited time, Amazon has the unlocked Samsung Galaxy S20 5G phone with US warranty for $800. Pay with your Amazon Prime Visa card and you\'ll get 15% cash back, bringing your net total down to $680.</p>
