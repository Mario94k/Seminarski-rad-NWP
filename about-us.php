	<p>Update May 5: Since the Galaxy S20 Ultra is still new, there aren’t many sales or price drops, and not much has changed. At least one system update has reached the device that corrected some Day One-type bugs. A second update is being distributed now that should make more improvements to the camera, specifically. More recently, the phone was updated with the May security patch from Google. </p>
	<p>The Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra 5G is ultra-everything. It offers every possible feature anyone could want in a phone and more. While the device boasts an impressive display, rapid performance, and powerful cameras, the price tag is so high that the phone is unaffordable to many. If you want the ultra-mate phone, you\'ll pay the ultra-mate price.</p>
	<p>Update, April 29, 2020 (01:52 PM ET): After an update rolled out last week that caused display issues on some Galaxy S20 devices, there’s a new Samsung Galaxy S20 update arriving that is a lot simpler. This time around, the update contains the May 2020 Android security patch and not much else.</p>
	<p>Samsung Galaxy S20, S20 Plus, and S20 Ultra updates. Samsung launched the family of Galaxy S20 phones on February 11, 2020. Pre-orders for the devices started on February 21 and the devices will land in stores on March 6. Every device in the family will launch with Android 10 out of the box (skinned over with Samsung’s One UI 2.0, of course).</p>
